>A tool based on the kanban method to manage the work of a person, team or company.

## Motivation
I knew the Kanban method, I found its principles incredible and I did not find Kanban open source software that I liked to use. So I dared to create one.

## How to use

### Download source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robisson/wipkanban
```

### Install dependences:
```bash
cd wipkanban

npm install
```

### Run application
```bash

npm run server

```
To access enter the address htts://<YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>:3000 in the browser

### Run tests
The tests are divided between client and server

```bash
#client tests
npm run test:client

#server
npm run test:server

```
